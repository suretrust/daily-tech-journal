#### (14-01-2020): Differences between an Array and a LinkedList

- An array has an index but a linkedlist doesn't.
- Array's index makes getting a value of known index constant time. You must iterate through a linkedlist to get a value.
- You cannot run a binary search on a linkedlist because you neither know the size of the list nor its mid-position without transversing the list. You can run a binary/linear search on an array. You can only run a linear search on a linkedlist.
- Insertions or deletions from a linkedlist is faster because you just need to change the pointers, in an array, you must shift back the remaining part of the array.
- An array can be multidimensional. Linkedlist can be singly or doubly.
